353215|US Composite PMI Revised Lower in August|2022-09-06T14:25:24.867|The S&P Global US Composite PMI was revised lower to 44.6 in August of 2022 from a preliminary estimate of 45, down from the 47.7 in July to signal the second consecutive contraction in private sector business and the sharpest since May 2020. The decline in service sector activity (43.7 vs 37.3 in July) more than offset the slight growth for US manufacturers (51.5 vs 52.2). Service providers registered a sharp decline in production and the downturn in new orders accelerated to a two-year low, while output and new business also contracted for US factories. Although still rising markedly, the rate of cost inflation softened to the slowest pace since January 2021, as lower demand drove companies to offer concessions to clients. In the meantime, employment growth dropped to January lows for both sectors. Pressure on capacity eased further for private companies as weaker demand cleared backlogs of work for service providers, while that for manufacturers rose marginally.|United States|Composite PMI|UNITEDSTACOMPMI|/united-states/composite-pmi
353216|French 10-Year Bond Yield at 2-Month High|2022-09-06T15:20:04.903|The yield on the French 10-year OAT rose to the 2.2% mark in September to hover at levels not seen since the end of June, as investors anticipate major central banks to remain hawkish for a prolonged time while awaiting the ECB’s interest rate decision on Thursday. While a 50bps rate was previously expected, bets of a more aggressive 75bps have gained momentum as inflation that rose to a fresh high of 9.1% in August. European bond yields were also pushed upwards by increasing bets that the Fed will prolong its hawkish stance after Chairman Powell stated that US borrowing costs will remain restrictive until inflation is significantly lower. In the meantime, France expects all of its nuclear reactors to be back online by the winter, slightly easing worries of energy shortages after corrosion problems and drying rivers caused multiple plants to be suspended as gas flows from Russia were shut off.|France|Government Bond 10Y|GFRN10|/france/government-bond-yield

353219|Italian Stocks Close Flat|2022-09-06T15:52:18.013|The FTSE MIB index closed a choppy session flat at 21,480 on Tuesday, failing to recover from yesterday’s sharp retreat as investors continued to weigh on how declining energy supplies may affect European economies ahead of higher borrowing costs by the ECB. Energy stocks booked the sharpest losses in the session, with Eni and Tenaris tracking lower crude prices to drop 3.5% and 2.7% on average. Utilities also closed sharply in the red, led by a near 5% drop for Hera after the Italian government announced it will reduce heating in households and stores to save gas in the winter, forecasting consumption to be reduced by 5.3 million cubic meters. On the other hand, sharp gains for banks and tech offset energy-related concerns. Pirelli and Stellantis added 3% and 1.5%, respectively, while Nexi shares jumped 1.6%.|Italy|Stock Market|FTSEMIB|/italy/stock-market
