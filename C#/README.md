# C# examples

Use this project as a reference how integrate your .NET application with Trading Economics data. The project provides general examples of how one can access the Trading Economics API using the programming language C#. The .cs files are divided by area of interest into the API.

## API Key

To access the information, a common test key **guest:guest** has been applied. To use your own key, you must go to the _App.config_ file and look for the appSettings value for the key _clientkey_

Search for: `<add key="clientkey" value="guest:guest"/>`

Changing the value **guest:guest** with your current API Key will make every example run under your subscription key.
